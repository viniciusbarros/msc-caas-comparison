# msc-caas-comparison

The goal of this project is to help organising the development of the MSc research that compares "Container as a Service" solutions available in public Cloud Service Providers (CSP).

This project will also host the source code that will be used to perform the tests and anylises.

The goal is to have this repository publicly available once the project is finished, so other enthusiasts could benefit from the outcome of the study.
